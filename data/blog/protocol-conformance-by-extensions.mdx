## Overview

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={(2, 3)}></TOCInline>

## What is Protocol Conformance with Extensions?

With protocol conformance by extensions, you can define the primary functionality of a class in one place (in the class itself) and then use extensions to separate and add related functionality via protocol conformance.

## Advantages

1. **Code Separation**

You can group related functionalities based on the protocols they adopt, which improves code organization and maintainability.

2. **Readability**

The main class focuses on its primary functionality, while protocol conformances are placed in separate extensions, making the code easier to read and understand.

3. **Reusability**

You can reuse the same extension to add protocol conformance to multiple classes or structures.

4. **Ease of Extension**

Adding new functionalities or conforming to new protocols becomes straightforward with extensions, as you don't need to modify the original class.

5. **Clearer Intent**

Extensions make it clear that certain functionalities are optional or add-ons, providing a clear separation of concerns.

## Example Usage

## When is it Useful?

This pattern is widely used in Swift development and is especially useful when adopting multiple protocols or when providing a way to extend existing classes without subclassing or modifying the original implementation.
