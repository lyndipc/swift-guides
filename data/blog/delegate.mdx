## What is the Delegate Pattern?

Design patterns play a crucial role in software development, enabling us to build scalable, maintainable, and flexible applications. They are reusable solutions to common problems that we encounter during the development process.

At its core, the delegate pattern allows one object (the delegate) to communicate and customize the behavior of another object (the delegating object) without the need for the delegating object to know the specific type of the delegate. It's comprised of two essential components:

1. **Delegate Protocol**

A protocol defines a set of methods that the delegate should implement. It acts as a contract, ensuring that any object acting as the delegate conforms to these methods.

2. **Delegating Class/Object**

The delegator holds a weak reference to the delegate and calls its methods whenever necessary. This allows the delegator to remain unaware of the delegate's specific implementation details.

## Advantages

This pattern promotes loose coupling between objects, making our codebase more modular and easier to maintain. It also allows us to customize the behavior of an object without the need to subclass it.
