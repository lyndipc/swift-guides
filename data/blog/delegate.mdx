## What is the Delegate Pattern?

Design patterns are crucial in software development, enabling us to build scalable, maintainable, and flexible applications. They are reusable solutions to common problems we encounter during development.

## How Does it Work?

At its core, the delegate pattern allows one object (the delegate) to communicate and customize the behavior of another object (the delegating object or the delegator) without requiring the delegator to know the specific type of delegate.

There are **two** essential components of the delegate pattern:

1. **Delegate Protocol**

The delegate protocol (or the **delegator**) defines a set of methods the delegating object should implement. The protocol works like a contract. Any object acting as the delegate must conform to the methods defined in the protocol.

2. **Delegating Class/Object**

The delegating object (or the **delegate**) contains specific implementation details related to the methods defined in the protocol (delegator). The methods in the delegate are only called whenever necessary by the delegator. This weak reference allows the delegator to remain unaware of the delegate's specific implementation details.

In other words, the delegator can learn the specific delegate type and how the delegate implements the protocol's methods, which makes the delegate pattern modular.

## Example Usage

Let's say we are building a mobile app that allows users to customize photos. In this scenario, we could implement the delegate pattern to allow users to add filters to their photos.

### Define the Delegator

To do this, we can create a photo processing delegate protocol that defines a method called `applyFilter`. This method takes in a `UIImage` and returns a `UIImage` with the filter applied.

```swift
protocol PhotoProcessingDelegate {
    func applyFilter(to image: UIImage) -> UIImage
}
```

Notice that the delegate protocol does not specify how to apply the filter. This generalization allows us to customize the filter's behavior within our delegate class.

### Create a Delegate Class

Here, the `Filter` class becomes the delegate because it conforms to the `PhotoProcessingDelegate` protocol. Implementing the `Filter` class should include the `applyFilter` method as specified in the protocol.

```swift
class Filter: PhotoProcessingDelegate {
    func applyFilter(to photo: UIImage) -> UIImage {
        // Apply filter to image
        return photo
    }
}
```

### Create a Class that Holds the Delegate

Next, we can create a `PhotoProcessor` class with a weak reference to the delegate and calls its `applyFilter` method whenever necessary.

```swift
class PhotoProcessor {
    weak var delegate: PhotoProcessingDelegate?

    func process(image: UIImage) {
        guard let delegate = delegate else { return }

        let filteredImage = delegate.applyFilter(to: image)
        // Do something with the filtered image
    }
}
```

The `PhotoProcessor` class doesn't need to know the specific type of the delegate. It only needs to understand that the delegate conforms to the `PhotoProcessingDelegate` protocol.

### Establish the Connection

Now, we can create an instance of the `PhotoProcessor` class and set the `Filter` instance as its delegate.

```swift
let photoProcessor = PhotoProcessor()
photoProcessor.delegate = Filter()
```

### Call the Delegate Method

When we call the `process` method on the `PhotoProcessor` instance, it will call the `applyFilter` method on the `Filter` instance, passing in the image as an argument.

```swift
photoProcessor.process(originalImage)
```

## Advantages

As you probably noticed in the example, the delegate pattern promotes loose coupling. Or, in simpler terms, this pattern flexibly connects components. The real power of the delegate pattern lies in its ability to allow us to customize the behavior of an object without the need to subclass it.

### Use Cases

The delegate pattern can become helpful in a variety of scenarios. However, one of the most common use cases that comes to mind is dealing with UI components. Implementing the delegate pattern to handle the behavior of the UI components without tightly coupling it to the data model can be extremely useful. Additionally, you may find that using the delegate pattern can be helpful in a few other situations, including:

- Customizing the behavior of a class without subclassing
- One-to-one relationships
- Event handling
- Customizing the behavior of a view controller

## Limitations

While this pattern can be beneficial, it's important to recognize when it's not worthwhile to implement it. For example, if you create a delegate protocol with only one method, it may be better to use a closure instead. Additionally, if a delegate is tightly coupled to the data, it may be better to use a subclass. A few other scenarios that you should be wary of when using the delegate pattern are:

- Performance-intensive operations
- One-to-many relationships
- Code complexity
- Retain cycles (when the delegate and delegator hold strong references to one another)

## Closing Thoughts

This post is a helpful introduction to the delegate pattern. If you have any questions or feedback, please contact me at **lyndi@swiftguides.xyz** or on [GitHub](https://github.com/lyndipc). Otherwise, research and experiment with the delegate pattern to see how to use it in your projects. Thanks for reading.
