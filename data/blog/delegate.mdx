## What is the Delegate Pattern?

Design patterns play a crucial role in software development, enabling us to build scalable, maintainable, and flexible applications. They are reusable solutions to common problems that we encounter during the development process.

## How Does it Work?

At its core, the delegate pattern allows one object (the delegate) to communicate and customize the behavior of another object (the delegating object, or the delegator) without the need for the delegator to know the specific type of the delegate.

The delegate pattern is made up of two essential components:

1. **Delegate Protocol**

A protocol defines a set of methods that the delegate should implement. It acts as a contract, ensuring that any object acting as the delegate conforms to these methods.

2. **Delegating Class/Object**

The delegator holds a weak reference to the delegate and calls its methods whenever necessary. This allows the delegator to remain unaware of the delegate's specific implementation details.

That's a lot of jargon, so let's look at an example to help us understand the delegate pattern better.

## Example Usage

Let's say that we're building a mobile app that allows users to customize photos. In this scenario, we could implement the delegate pattern to allow users to add filters to their photos.

1. Define the Delegate Protocol

To do this, we can create a photo processing delegate protocol that defines a method called `applyFilter`. This method takes in a `UIImage` and returns a `UIImage` with the filter applied.

```swift
protocol PhotoProcessingDelegate {
    func applyFilter(to image: UIImage) -> UIImage
}
```

Notice that the delegate protocol doesn't specify how the filter should be applied. This allows us to customize the behavior of the filter without the need to subclass it.

2. Create the Delegating Class/Object

Next, we can create a `PhotoProcessor` class that holds a weak reference to the delegate and calls its `applyFilter` method whenever necessary.

```swift
class PhotoProcessor {
    weak var delegate: PhotoProcessingDelegate?

    func process(image: UIImage) {
        guard let delegate = delegate else { return }

        let filteredImage = delegate.applyFilter(to: image)
        // Do something with the filtered image
    }
}
```

The `PhotoProcessor` class doesn't need to know the specific type of the delegate. It only needs to know that the delegate conforms to the `PhotoProcessingDelegate` protocol.

3. Create the Delegate

Here, the `Filter` class becomes the delegate because it conforms to the `PhotoProcessingDelegate` protocol. Which means that it must implement the `applyFilter` method as defined in the protocol earlier.

```swift
class Filter: PhotoProcessingDelegate {
    func applyFilter(to photo: UIImage) -> UIImage {
        // Apply filter to image
        return photo
    }
}
```

4. Establish the Connection

Now, we can create an instance of the `PhotoProcessor` class and set the `Filter` instance as its delegate.

```swift
let photoProcessor = PhotoProcessor()
let customFilter = Filter()

photoProcessor.delegate = customFilter
```

5. Call the Delegate Method

When we call the `process` method on the `PhotoProcessor` instance, it will call the `applyFilter` method on the `Filter` instance, passing in the image as an argument.

```swift
photoProcessor.process(originalImage)
```

## Advantages

This pattern promotes loose coupling between objects, making our codebase more modular and easier to maintain. It also allows us to customize the behavior of an object without the need to subclass it.
