## Overview

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={(2, 3)}></TOCInline>

## Introduction

Crafting an engaging application design is a crucial step in creating a successful app. One way to enhance the user interface is by using custom fonts to create a unique and visually appealing design. This tutorial will show you how to add custom fonts to a SwiftUI project and use them in your views.

## How to Add Custom Fonts in your SwiftUI Project

### Step 1: Downloading Custom Fonts

Download the font files in a format that is supported by iOS, such as TTF, OTF, or WOFF. You can find free fonts on reputable websites like [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/), and [DaFont](https://www.dafont.com/).

### Step 2: Adding Font Files to Xcode Project

1. Locate the font files and drag them into the Xcode project's `Assets` folder.
2. Check the "Copy items if needed" checkbox to ensure the fonts are included in the app bundle.

### Step 3: Updating the info.plist

1. Click on your project's name in the Project Navigator.
2. Select the `Info` tab.
3. Hover over the last row and click the `+` button to add a new row.
4. Enter `Fonts provided by application` as the key.
5. Expand the newly added row and enter the name of each font file in the (String) value column.

### Step 4: Using Custom Fonts in SwiftUI Views

Now, you are ready to apply the fonts to your SwiftUI views. Follow these steps to use custom fonts in your SwiftUI views:

1. Add the font modifier to a text view.
2. Initialize the Font struct using the custom font name and desired size, like so:

```swift
Text("Swift is cool.")
    .font(Font.custom("Lobster", size: 24))
```

## Styling Text with Custom Fonts

You can modify the font size, weight, color, and other styling properties using the `.font` modifier. For example, you can change the font weight and text color like you would with system fonts:

```swift
Text("Swift is cool.")
    .font(Font.custom("Lobster", size: 24))
    .fontWeight(.bold)
    .foregroundColor(.red)
```

## Conclusion

Adding custom fonts to your SwiftUI project is a great way to enhance the user interface and create a unique design. There are many free fonts available online that you can use to create a visually appealing app. Always be sure to check the font's license before using it in your project. You can find more information about using custom fonts in the [Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/text_display_and_fonts/adding_a_custom_font_to_your_app).
