## What are Generics?

Generics enable you to write flexible and reusable functions, structures, classes, and enumerations that can work with any type.

## Generic Functions

Functions can be written to take in parameters of a generic type, allowing them to work with different types of data. For instance, a generic function might sort an array of any type of elements, not just integers or strings.

This is achieved by using placeholders for types. These placeholders, known as **type parameters**, allow you to write a function without specifying the actual data types. The type parameters are specified when the function is called, and the function is then generated specifically for those types. Let's take a look at how this works.

### Generic Function Syntax

The syntax for a generic function is similar to that of a regular function, except that it includes a type parameter in the function signature. The type parameter is specified in angle brackets (`<>`) after the function name, and is used as a placeholder for the actual type. A generic function can take in parameters of the type specified by the type parameter, and can also return a value of that type.

```swift
func functionName<T>(parameter: T) -> T {
    // function body
}
```

The type parameter can be named anything you want, but it is common to use a single uppercase letter to indicate that it is a placeholder for a type.

### Generic Function Example

Let's take a look at a generic function that prints out the contents of an array. The function takes in an array of any type, and prints out each element on a new line.

```swift
func printArray<T>(array: [T]) {
    for element in array {
        print(element)
    }
}
```

The function takes in an array of type `T`, and prints out each element in the array. The type parameter `T` is a placeholder for the actual type of the array elements. The type parameter is specified in angle brackets (`<>`) after the function name, and is used as a placeholder for the actual type.
